A story deriving from the eleventh-century Iranian poet, Unṣurī in his work titled, ""The Virgin and Her Lover"". The story is an epic retelling of the Greek 1st century story of Parthenope and Metiochus. In this embroidery, Vamiq and Azra are seated on a carpet, facing one another, seemingly in conversation. The scene likely depicts their debate over ""Eros"" or the effigy of love, as found in both the Persian and Greek tellings of the story.  The Farsi script above the embroidered characters is not legible but one decipherable word in the sentence appears to mention the word ""agree"" , perhaps referencing Vamiq and Azra's discussion of love and their potential agreement with their interpretations.",textiles; robes; embroidery; vamiqazra,"Central Asia; Current: Aga Khan Museum, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.",43.725437,-79.332254,"Hidden Stories: Books Along the Silk Roads exhibit, Aga Khan Museum.

The following excerpt from the Chester Beatty Online Collection provides further detail for the depicted scene: ""One day, he had the opportunity to drink the water of life, and to live forever. Hesitating, he decided first to take advice from the animals and birds. They all gathered at his court, and discussed the great decision. The heron advised the king not to choose immortality. There was only enough water for one person, the bird said, so if Solomon were to drink it, then he would outlive everyone he loved.""",illumination; manuscript; solomon,"Agra, India",27.178593782867935,78.0088478084135,"Manuscript of ""Lights of Canopus"" (Anvar-i-Suhayli); Chester Beatty Online Collections",In 04.74,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,"Persian, Nasta'liq script",Creative Commons,https://chesterbeatty.ie/about/copyright-2/,image,/objects/dhsi5.jpg,/objects/small/dhsi5_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/dhsi5_th.jpg,,
